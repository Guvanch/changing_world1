<p><strong>Keynote Speaker</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Ashley</strong>,<br />
Director, Digital Curation Centre, UK</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that <strong>Kevin Ashley</strong>, Director of the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) in the UK since 2010, has agreed to be the keynote speaker at IMCW2014.</p>
<p>Mr. Ashley has been responsible to increase the enabling capacity and capability of DCC amongst the research community in matters of digital curation, as the DCC was set up by JISC in 2004 to give practical advice and guidance to colleges and universities on digital preservation, curation and information management. His specialties are digital curation; digital preservation training; electronic record management; and hybrid archives.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mr. Ashley worked as the Head of Digital Archives at the University of London Computer Centre (ULCC) for 13 years, during which time his multi-disciplinary group has provided services related to the preservation and reusability of digital resources on behalf of other organisations, as well as conducting research, development and training. At ULCC, Dr Ashley&#8217;s group operated the National Digital Archive of Datasets (NDAD) for The National Archives of the UK for over twelve years, capturing, preserving, describing and releasing government data.</p>
<p>Mr Ashley was chair of the JISC Repositories and Preservation Advisory Group and is currently a member of JISC&#8217;s Infrastructure and Resources committee. He is on the steering committee for the Archives Hub at MIMAS and the policy working group of the <a href="http://dl.org/" target="_blank">DL.ORG</a> project. He was part of the task force that developed the RLG/NARA audit checklist for trusted digital repositories, and was a member of the NSF-DELOS Working Group on Digital Archiving and Preservation which produced the report &#8220;Invest To Save&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr. Ashley holds a BSc degree in Mathematics from University College London.</p>
<p><strong>Inverting the Pyramid: Maximising the Value of Data to Society</strong></p>
<p>A traditional view of data sees it as a bulk item which, through a process of successive refinement, analysis and selection, leads to nuggets of wisdom, insight or knowledge. Such pyramidical representations can be seen in views from the worlds of knowledge management, research lifecycles and publishing. They assume that data is created with a particular purpose in mind and that only one analysis produces anything of lasting value. This is true for some cases, but it fails to represent the full potential of most data. I will argue, and show through example, that data&#8217;s true value is realised by enabling reuse in contexts that can be far removed from its original creation. This includes data created for administrative and other uses as well as data created for the purposes of academic or industrial research. I will also describe some of the initiatives and services around the world that are helping to realise this value in data.</p>

<strong>Keynote Speaker</strong></p>
<p>Professor <strong>Michael Seadle</strong><br />
Director of the Berlin School for Library and Information Science<br />
Dean of the Faculty of Arts I, Humboldt University<br />
Chair of the ISchools Caucus<br />
Germany</p>
<p>Professor<strong> Michael Seadle</strong> has agreed to deliver a keynote address at IMCW2014.</p>
<p>Professor <strong>Seadle</strong> holds a PhD degree in History from the University of Chicago and an MS degree in Information Science from the University of Michigan. He is currently Dean of the Faculty of Arts I as well as the Director of the Berlin School of Library and Information Science (Institut für Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft) at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and serves as the chair of ISchools Caucus comprising more than 50 ISchools around the world. Prior to his current position, Professor Seadle served in various administrative capacities at the University of Chicago and Cornell University, among others, and carried out sponsored projects (LC, NSF, IMLS, DFG). He is the co-editor of the peer-reviewed journal &#8220;Library Hi Tech&#8221; published by Emerald. He has written more than 100 papers and authored books on long term digital archiving, computing management and copyright.</p>
<p><strong>Title: &#8220;Managing and Mining Historical Research Data over Time.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Abstract. This keynote addresses three interrelated issues in information management: 1) how to structure humanities research data for content mining, 2) how humanities data mining functions now and may function in the future, and 3) how to ensure that the data are there in 100 or more years. These three issues have an obvious curricular component as well, which is necessary in order to train students to prepare and to exploit the data. At present the management of research data takes place separately from the creation and use of that data, for example in libraries and computer centres, but that may be less true in a future where research teams include data scientists as standard and even as equal members. Concrete examples in this talk will use historical research data, but the principles apply generally to humanities research data. Research data from the natural sciences often has a different structure and is processed differently. For that reason those data will not be discussed in this keynote.</p>
